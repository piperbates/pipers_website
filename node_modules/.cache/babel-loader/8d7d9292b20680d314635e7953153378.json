           illustrator, working on children's books, comics, infographics and\r\n              more. While I still love to draw, I realised I didn't want to do\r\n              it as a career, and started looking for a change. That's when I\r\n              found the School of Code.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              I'd dabbled in small coding projects in the past, mostly HTML and\r\n              CSS with a tiny bit of vanilla javascript thrown in for good luck,\r\n              and while had always found it fascinating, it felt inaccessable\r\n              and hard to get into. The vast majority of people I saw working in\r\n              tech were middle class men, and I didn't feel like I would\r\n              necessarily fit in with the culture I imagined it to be.{\" \"}\r\n            </p>\r\n            <div className=\"highlighted-box\">\r\n              <p>\r\n                Thanks to some incredible role models, including woman and many\r\n                non binary people, I've discovered that my initial analisis of\r\n                the culture of tech couldn't be further from the truth, and\r\n                there is absolutely a place for me here - and what's more,\r\n                people like me are needed in the industry!\r\n              </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n          <div id=\"about-now-box\" className=\"about-story-box\">\r\n            <h2>A New Start, in Troubling Times...</h2>\r\n            <p>\r\n              When Covid19 first started trickling into public knowledge, I had\r\n              just finished a large scale project which had me questioning\r\n              whether freelancing was te right place for me. I've always been\r\n              passionate about creativity and storytelling, but working for\r\n              myself, on my own, left me feeling like something was missing.\r\n              Then lockdown began, and my illustration work dried up, I started\r\n              looking for other options.

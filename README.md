# Pipers Website 2.0

It'd been 2 years since I made this website and it was time for an upgrade. I've kept the general layout the same, it's still a one page scrolling website but now with added TypeScript to make it type safe, and the components are a lot neater. There are some bugs which I'm addressing, as well as some typing that I got lazy with that is being fixed.

Now I think I need to update some of those projects on the coding projects page because, err, yeah, they're also a little out dated and not examples of my best work!!

I'm also planning on putting an Online CV (with downloadable PDF version!) into the page but that's going to involve a bit of structuring before it works and I wanted to get some kind of update out before I did that (some of the basics of it are already are in the codebase though).

## A few todos...
* The custom hook `useOnOutsideClick` has some `any` typing
* Annoying basic fonts, Next JS doesn't seem to want to have the fonts work
* Images have preset widths so the images look icky on the modal

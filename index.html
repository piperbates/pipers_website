                <span class="emphasis">Hi, I'm Piper!</span> I'm a 34 year old non binary person who has been dabbling in code for years, without ever realising I could turn my weird hobby into a career.
                </p> 
                
                <p>Before School of Code, I was working as a freelance illustrator, and have illustrated children's books, published comic strips, and worked for a bunch of companies designing brochuers. I love to draw and create,
                but the isolation of working for myself has never been ideal, and I would much rather work on my own personal projects rather than illustration work for other people.
                </p> 
                <p>I love working in teams with other creative people,
                collaborating on projects and coming up with new ideas, so when I saw School of Code was open for applicants, I knew this was the path for me!
                </p>

                <h2>More information about Piper</h2>
                    <p>
                        Outside of coding and drawing, I'm pretty much constantly getting myself into new things. I'm passionate about so many things.
                        I'm very interested in social politics, especially LGBTQIA+ rights, gender equality, feminism, anti-racism and all that Social Justice
                        Warrior stuff (although do consider myself more of a social justice bard).
                        </p>
                    <p>In my free time, I'm likely to be found playing videogames or playing my ukulele and pretending I can sing.                          
                        I live in Warwick with my partner, our housemate, and 6 pet rats!

                <p class="question">Favourite videogame?</p>
                <p class="answer">This changes on a regular basis but I recently finished Subnautica for the first time and absolutely loved it (despite it terrifying me). I also love the Pok√©mon 
                    main games, Animal Crossing, Overwatch, and Minecraft. Not a huge fan of (most) FPS or Horror games, but will happily play them with a group of friends or if the storyline is good.

                <p class="question">
                    What are your pronouns? 
                </p>
                <p class="answer">
                    They / them! I do not like she / her or he / him pronouns and will probably correct you if you get it wrong. However, if you <strong>do</strong> get it
                    wrong, I won't be angry or upset! Making an effort &gt; accuracy. (If you don't understand why I prefer they / them pronouns, <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/what-does-it-mean-to-be-non-binary-or-have-non-binary-gender-4172702#:~:text=Non%2Dbinary%20gender%20identity%20is,gender%2C%20or%20something%20else%20entirely.">check out this article</a> which explains
                    what being non-binary means)

                    Do you have a nickname?
                </p>
                <p class="answer">
                    I mean, if "Piper" is too much of a mouthful for you, I like Pip, Pippin, or Pippo. Not a fan of Pipes, but feel free to tease me and see where it gets you ;)

                <p class="question">
                    What are your tattoos?
                </p>
                <p class="answer">I have 6 tattoos (and would like more). I have a triceratops tattoo on my right shoulderblade, a raven tattoo on my left shoulderblade, a rat pawprint from one
                    of my pet rats who died in 2018, a tattoo of Marcelene the Vampire Queen next to a pumpkin on my left shoulder, and a sunflower / anchor on my right shoulder. Some of them have
                    meanings, others don't. I love tattoos!

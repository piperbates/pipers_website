const pastText = "After spending 5 years as a freelance illustrator, in 2020 I decided I wanted a change and jumped head first into the School of Code. I loved my experience at the bootcamp and shortly after it ended landed my first position in the industry as a Junior Software Engineer at Click Travel. I quickly learnt that there was a surprising amount of crossover between illustration and software engineering - they are both very creative fields with strong collaborative elements and I finally found a career tht I am genuinely passionate about."

const futureText="I can't imagine not working in a creative field, and my plans for the future revolve around this. I hope to be constantly growing and developing myself, my skills, and being able to build better and better tech. Working within a company that values growth, giving me the opportunity to better myself every day, would be like a dream come true for me. I'd ideally like to work in a company where I can really make a difference with my skills and perspectives, as my unique background before the tech industry means I have a lot more to offer. I've now realised that tech is an industry in which you need people from diverse backgrounds in order to properly solve the problems of today, and I'm ready to bring that into any future role. If you think that might be with you and your company, get in touch with me!"

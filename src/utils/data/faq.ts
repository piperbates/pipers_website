            "In 2020 I was working as a freelance illustrator where I loved the illustration part of my job but not so much the freelance. When my contracts dried up because of the Covid lockdown, I decided to retrain as a software engineer where I studied at the School of Code. Having a limited experienced of software engineering before this, mainly through dabbling with HTML and CSS whilst managing my own website, I found the course challenging but immensely rewarding and quickly fell in love with front end development.",
            "On a more personal note, I'm a very creative person who always has their hands on a new crafty project, and enjoy playing videogames."

I want to work for companies that aren't just focussed on the bottom line, but on developing a product that is beloved by its users.

        question: "What benefits are you expecting, inc salary expectations?",

            "Salary isn't my biggest motivation, but for a ballpark figure my last role I was earning Â£40k pa.",
            "I prefer working remotely or hybrid depending on frequency, however I am looking to relocate to Bristol in the near future so would be willing to be flexible on this for an office in the Bristol area especially if there is assistance with relocation."

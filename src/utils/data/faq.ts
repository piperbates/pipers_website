        answer: [
            "In 2020 I was working as a freelance illustrator where I loved the illustration part of my job but not so much the freelance. When my contracts dried up because of the Covid lockdown, I decided to retrain as a software engineer where I studied at the School of Code. Having a limited experienced of software engineering before this, mainly through dabbling with HTML and CSS whilst managing my own website, I found the course challenging but immensely rewarding and quickly fell in love with front end development.",
            "On a more personal note, I'm a very creative person who always has their hands on a new crafty project, and enjoy playing videogames."

            "I value supportive teams that understand that the best code is built with the best culture. I want to work for companies that aren't just focussed on the bottom line, but on developing a product that is beloved by its users. I believe in the power of Agile methodologies, accesibility, and strong testing.",

    {
        question: "What benefits are you expecting, inc salary expectations?",
        answer: [
            "I'm more interested in hearing how much you value the role I'm interviewing for. I prefer being up front about salary as honesty in these settings can save a lot of time. For transparency, at my last role I was earning Â£40k per annum, however I am very flexible and will consider any salary for the right company.",
            "I prefer working remotely or hybrid depending on frequency, however for the right company I am happy to reconsider this."
